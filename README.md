# 🦒 Wildlife Guardian Rewards

Welcome to a decentralized solution for combating wildlife poaching! This Web3 project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to incentivize informants by rewarding them with tokens for verified wildlife sightings. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, we create a trustless system that encourages community participation in conservation efforts, reducing poaching through timely reporting and verified actions.

## ✨ Features

🦒 Submit anonymous or verified wildlife sightings with evidence (e.g., hashes of photos/videos)  
✅ Community or oracle-based verification of sightings to ensure authenticity  
💰 Reward informants with native tokens from a community-funded pool  
🔒 Stake tokens to become a verifier and earn fees for accurate validations  
📊 Track poaching hotspots via on-chain data analytics  
🚨 Automated alerts and escalation to authorities via integrated oracles  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism to handle false claims  
🌍 Governance for community-driven updates to reward parameters  

## 🛠 How It Works

This system involves 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to handle registration, submissions, verification, rewards, and governance. It solves the real-world problem of wildlife poaching by providing financial incentives for early detection, while ensuring fairness through decentralized validation.

**For Informants**  
- Register as an informant (optional for anonymity).  
- Submit a sighting with details like location, species, and evidence hash.  
- Once verified by the community or oracles, automatically claim rewards from the pool based on the sighting's impact (e.g., rarity of species).  

**For Verifiers/Validators**  
- Stake tokens to participate in verification.  
- Vote on or confirm sightings using provided evidence.  
- Earn a share of rewards for correct verifications; lose stake for malicious behavior.  

**For Donors and Conservation Groups**  
- Fund the reward pool with tokens.  
- Participate in governance to adjust reward tiers or add new species.  

**For Authorities/Researchers**  
- Query on-chain data for sighting trends and hotspots.  
- Use verified data to deploy anti-poaching teams.  

Boom! A transparent, incentive-driven network that turns community eyes into a powerful anti-poaching force.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

The project is built with 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity and security:  
1. **Token Contract**: Manages the reward token (e.g., ERC-20 equivalent in Clarity) for payouts and staking.  
2. **Informant Registry**: Handles user registration and anonymity options.  
3. **Sighting Submission**: Allows submission of sightings with metadata and evidence hashes.  
4. **Verification Voting**: Enables staked verifiers to vote on sighting authenticity.  
5. **Oracle Integration**: Connects to external oracles for automated evidence checks (e.g., GPS validation).  
6. **Reward Pool**: Manages funded tokens and distributes rewards based on verification outcomes.  
7. **Dispute Resolution**: Allows challenges to verifications with slashing mechanisms for bad actors.  
8. **Governance DAO**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on system updates, like reward multipliers.  

Each contract interacts via public functions, ensuring the system is composable and auditable on the Stacks blockchain.
